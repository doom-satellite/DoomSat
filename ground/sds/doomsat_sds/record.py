"""Phase D, the file seam: ask the payload for its own record of an episode, downlink it, check it against L1.

    plan      which file to ask for and what to call it on the ground
    request   the one command the data system ever sends: cfdpManager SendFile, through Yamcs
    observe   how the downlink stands, read only: SendFile's answer, cfdpManager's events, Yamcs's CFDP transfers
    ingest    the downlinked file, read from Yamcs's bucket cfdpDown, becomes the L0 product `l0_record`
    compare   the record against the L1 episode built from the archive; every disagreement is a finding

The payload (payload/episode_record.py, with --records on) writes $DOOMSAT_HOME/run/rec/<episode>-<last tic>.json
when an episode ends. The ground knows both numbers without asking: the episode from L1, the last tic from the
PlayerDied/LevelFinished event (or, after a reset or a WAD switch, from the last TIC sample, which only works if
that status reached the ground). On main the file goes down as a CCSDS CFDP class 2 transfer: cfdpManager reads
it, Yamcs's CfdpService rebuilds it, checks its checksum and saves it in the bucket cfdpDown under the
destination name, with "(1)", "(2)"... added when that name is taken. There is no file on disk to watch, so the
wait polls Yamcs's transfer list with a GET; nothing here POSTs to /filetransfer, so nothing here starts, pauses
or cancels a transfer. Once ingested, the object is deleted: cfdpDown holds 1000 objects and 100 MB.

What the flight software and Yamcs do, which shapes the code:
- F' command strings hold at most 40 characters on board (FW_CMD_STRING_MAX_SIZE), although the dictionary says
  200; a longer path is a FORMAT_ERROR. Paths are kept to 39. The absolute path is used when it fits, otherwise
  the same file relative to the F' binary's working directory, which is build-artifacts/<OS>/DoomSat/bin.
- cfdpManager answers SendFile OK when it has queued the transfer, and fails later, asynchronously, if the file
  cannot be opened: TxFileOpenFailed or TxZeroLengthFile, then TxFileTransferFailed. No metadata PDU is sent
  then, so Yamcs never lists a transfer, and those events end the wait at once.
- In class 2 Yamcs completes a transfer only when F' acknowledges its Finished PDU. A transfer that ends FAILED
  with "File was received OK but the Finished PDU has not been acknowledged" has left its checksum-verified
  object in the bucket all the same: it is ingested, and the lost acknowledgement is recorded as a finding.
- F' events carry the spacecraft's time, about 0.9 s ahead of Yamcs's clock, which stamps the command and the
  transfer; F' numbers transactions from 1 at every boot. So a transfer is found by its source path and the
  time Yamcs created it, and the event window opens a little before the command. Yamcs creates a downlink when
  its first PDU arrives, after F' has the command, so this request's transfer is never older than the command.
